# Video-Making-Automation-CPP
Recreation of my C program CPP
A toolkit of program to create the video from images.

## How?
The goal is to write program that make a video from images.
in place of human manual labour. This means a partially-autonomous 
editing workflow, where the human must strategically use the toolkit 
of programs to achieve their desired results. My rough personal guess 
is that when implemented correctly, this could save about 80% of my 
time spent editing.

This project uses the [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) l
ibrary to handle much of the heavy lifting of video processing, 
and intends to build a library ontop of ffmpeg without changing 
the ffmpeg source code.
This project and its functions are their own isolated work 
(unless stated otherwise), however they do require linking with 
ffmpeg to operate correctly.[View the ffmpeg source code](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) or[Read the compilation guide](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Generic)

If you would like to run this code you need to first install ffmpeg by compiling
the source (link above).

- **output.c** (source code with driver function)
- **examples/** (examples of output video and showcase )
- **function.h** (header files for output.c)
- **Limit**(this is just a first vesrion so it only runs for limited files)
